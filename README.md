# AstroRefraction
A python package for the calculation of astronomical (atmospheric) refraction

**This package is currently under development**

## Coming soon

The following items are planned for inclusion in this package:

### Refraction

* Stone 1996 - valid down to z~70Â°, using US Standard Atmosphere 1976
* Pulkovo 1985 - the standard refraction tables, using Soviet Standard Atmosphere COST 4401-73
* raytracing - direct calculation in an arbitrary atmosphere on an ellipsoid

### Atmospheres

* International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
* COST 4401-73 and COST 4401-81
* user defined atmosphere
* (likely) archival balloon data from IGRA

### Apertures
For the calculation of differential fluxloss due to refraction in spectroscopic observations the following apertures will be provided

* rectangular - slit or slitlets
* circular - fiber
